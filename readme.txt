Gameplay
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a space pilot hired to rescue pilots imprisoned on an alien
planet. After landing you can pickup a few weapons and a medikit from
your spaceship, then move through the door to confront the aliens!

Your sight is blocked by walls, so you won't see an enemy until you or
they come round the corner. Bushes will block bullets when hit from a
distance, so you can use them as bunkers by standing in them or behind
them.

The prisoner can be found in the North. He will follow you most of the
time. You can press F to tell him to stay where he is, or press F again
to make him follow you. The goal is to lead the prisoner back to your
spaceship so you can both escape. If the prisoner dies or you are in a
real hurry, you can also escape without the prisoner.

Use the keyboard (W,A,S,D) to move, and use the mouse to look around and
fire your weapons. Select your current weapon using the number keys, or
the mouse wheel.

When hit you can receive up to three wounds, slowing you down. Using a
medikit (M) will heal all wounds you currently have.

On your way back from the prison, dead enemies towards the South will
respawn once.

After every mission, a more dangerous mission begins. If you rescued
the prisoner, extra ammo will be available at the start of the next
mission.
